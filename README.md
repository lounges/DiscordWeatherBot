# DiscordWeatherBot

A simple chat bot for Discord which queries Weather Underground and returns the weather for the specified postal code.

NOTE: This codebase does not include an api key for Weather Underground.  You must sign up for a key here: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ and create a file called "Api.Key" which contains the key.
